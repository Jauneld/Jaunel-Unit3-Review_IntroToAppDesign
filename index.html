  <h2>Lesson #1 - Introduction to Apps</h2>
  <p>We begin this unit by examining the basics of an app and how users interact with the apps. We also learned about the inputs and outputs that occur so the app can function.

    <h2>Lesson #2 - Introduction to Design Mode</h2>
  <p>We learnt how to create screens, buttons, images, text, and more inside of App Lab.
  </p>
  <h5>Why is it important for element IDs to have meaningful names?
  </h5>
  <h6>It is important for element IDs to have meaningful names because it allows for easy identification for the programmer to review the code and easily identify problems with certain code.
  </h6>

  <div class="div">
    <h2>Lesson #3 - Project Designing an App Part 1</h2>
  <p>We made progress on building their own functional app. We brainstormed what the app should portray and drew wireframes to plan the app. 
  </p>
  <h5>App Wireframe

  <h6>Deciding on the App's topic

  <div class="div">
    <h2>Lesson #4 - Project Designing an App Part 2</h2>
  <p>We continued to follow the app development process outlined in their App Development Guide by transferring our user interfaces designs from the planning guide over to App Lab.

  <h5>Instructions of Work

    <h2>Lesson #5 - The Need for Programming Languages</h2>
  <p>
   We progressed on building our own functional app. We asked classmates to look at the designs and what we need to change on the wireframe. We did an activity to show that clear instructions is needed for something to work. 
  </p>
  <h5>What is the difference between a programming language and natural (every-day) language?
 </h5>
  <h6>Programming language is much more specific while natural language can be open to interpretation.
  </h6>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div class="div">
    <h2>Lesson #6 - Intro to Programming</h2>
  <p>We got familiar with what programs are and how they run by using and modifying several working apps.
  </p>
  <h5>What is the difference between a sequential program and an event-driven program?
  </h5>
  <h6>Sequential programming statements run in order, from top to bottom every single time. The program runs the same every time. Event driven programming statements run when triggered by an event.
  </h6>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div class="div">  
    <h2>Lesson #7 - Debugging</h2>
  <p>We learnt how to identify and fix problems in your code through the debugging process. Then practice using it with a classmate.
  </p>
  <h5><ul type="">
      <li>
        What is one thing you really enjoyed about today's activity?
      </li>
      <li>
        Is there anything that you found confusing or need extra help with?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </h5>
  <h6>
    When you work together, you can always have someone check your work and see where your mistakes are made. Collaboration makes the work easier. Something that was confused about if about what someone was trying to convey to me. Sometimes they didn't explain properly, and it was hard to decipher their explanation.

    <h2>Lesson #8 - Project Designing an App Part 3</h2>
  <p>We continue to design app and learn how to effectively use pair programming to collaborate while writing code. We began adding programming statements to each onEvent block

    <h2>Lesson #9 - Project Designing an App Part 4</h2>
  <p>We continue working on our app and get feedback to make sure we were on the right track.

  <p>We complete our app and share it with classmates before reflecting on the overall process of designing the app.</p>
